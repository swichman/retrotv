This project was done to introduce myself to the process of creating an instructable. You can find the project [here](https://www.instructables.com/Retro-Idiot-Box/).

This software was updated beyond the instructable, but not as far as it could have been. Use at your own risk, and feel free to change the code to meet whatever needs.
